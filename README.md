# üèÄ NBA Player Stats - Snowflake ETL & Analytics Project

This project demonstrates how to perform ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and analytical queries using **Snowflake** with a dataset of the top 100 NBA player stats. It includes:

- Uploading a CSV dataset to Snowflake
- Creating and populating tables
- Running analytical SQL queries
- Exploring player and team performance

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset is based on the top 100 NBA players and includes statistics like:
- Player name
- Team
- Points per game
- Assists
- Rebounds
- Steals 
- Blocks
- Turnovers
- Fouls
- Field Goal %, Three Point %, Effective Field Goal%, and Free Throw %

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Snowflake** (Cloud Data Warehouse)
- **SQL** (Snowsight Web UI)
- **CSV File** (Uploaded manually)

## üöÄ Steps

### 1. Upload the CSV
Upload the `top100_player_stats.csv` file into Snowflake using the Snowsight UI

### 2. Create the Table
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE player_stats (
    PLAYER	TEXT
    AGE INT
    TEAM TEXT
    POS	TEXT
    FG	FLOAT
    THREEPOINT	FLOAT
    EFFECTIVEFG	FLOAT
    FREETHROW	FLOAT
    REBOUNDS	FLOAT
    ASSISTS	FLOAT
    STEALS	FLOAT
    BLOCKS	FLOAT
    TURNOVERS	FLOAT
    FOULS	FLOAT
    POINTS	FLOAT
);
```

### 3. Load the Data
Used the load data wizard in snowflake to update the data to the table, PLAYER_STAT, in the NBA_STATS_DB database

### 4. Create and Run Analytical Queries
Examples shown in the .sql files with the results in the .csv files
